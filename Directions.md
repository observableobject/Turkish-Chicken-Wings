## Grilled Turkish-Style Wings 

## Directions

1. Mix Pepper paste, EVOO, parsley, garlic, and pomegranite syrup well. Mix in salt, pepper, and spices. Transfer the pepper paste into a sall bowl for brushing later (Refrigerate if cooking the following day).
2. Douse and thoroughly combine the remaining paste on the chicken wings, using large ziploc bags or by shaking a sealed container. Remove air. Massage and mix until the wings are evenly coated.  Refrigerate, frequently turning bags, between 2 and 24 hours. 
3. After marination, thread the wings unto metal skewers (Water-Saturated Bamboo Skewers are an option).  Spring the wings 1-2 inches apart.  Separate flats and drumettes, skewering the flats between bones and alternate the drumettes.  Bunch wings tightly, leaving no exposed skewers except the handle.
