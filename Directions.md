## Grilled Turkish-Style Wings 

## Directions

### Marination

1) Use a large bowl to add all the chicken wings (big enough to mix all the ingredients in and small enough to fit into the fridge)
2) If you want to add garlic into the sauce add the minced garlic into the bowl
3) Then add 1 table spoon of plain yogurt for every 6 wings into the bowl
4) Add 1 desert spoon of pepper paste for every 6 wings into the bowl
5) Add 1 desert spoon of vegetable oil for every 6 wings into the bowl
6) Add 1 desert spoon of salt, Turkish red pepper flakes (or paprika) and 0.5 desert spoon of black pepper into the bowl
7) Mix all the ingridients until everything is mixed evenly
8) Put the marination bowl into the fridge for 24 hours (Use a plastic wrap to cover the marination bowl)

### Cooking

1) Prepare the grille to low temperture (What ever that means for a traditional BBQ set in US? - Derek & Vince)

**Important Note** : Usually a Turkish grill is basically a open metal box where the coal embers are inside. Low temprerature refers to less embers underneath the shish in this context. Refer to the following video for a better understanding:
[Cooking Chicken Wings on Turkish BBQ](https://youtu.be/us80_CKOkSM?t=340)
It is crucial to cook the wings slowly. Cooking them at high temperatures will cause the skin to be charred quickly where as they will be raw inside. 

2) Put the wings on the shish (6-7 wings per shish) as shown in the video. If shishes(skewers) available are thinner than the ones shown in the video above, you can use two of them together. (You can even use a fish basket - Derek & Vince)
3) Start putting the skewers on the grill and make sure to flip the sides every few minutes to prevent the wings to be burned. 
4) When the wings are cooked for a while sliced the bread (Italian bread is the best) into half and place the skewers on top of a slice. This will allow
the bread to suck on some of the juicy sauce on the wings. (Yummm) 
5) Also at this point, use a sharp knife to slice through the wings as they rest on the bread. These little slices on the wings will make the insides cook
better. Also make sure to slide the wings on the skewer as they tend to stick to the metal during grilling. 
6) Once the wings are all sliced place them back on the grille.
7) Once the wings are all cooked inside out, you can increase the temperature to char the outside which will give them a crispy taste. 
8) You can also put the sliced bread on top of the skewers to toast them. That will make them moist and chruncy and they will have a nice smoky taste to them too. 
9) Once everything is cooked, you can put the skewers between the slices of bread and pull the skewer out. This will leave the wings between the slices of bread and they are ready to be served. 

Bon apetit!
